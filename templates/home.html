	<h1>Behavioural Scoring based on Social Activity and Financial Analytics</h1>
    <br>
    <h4> We are presenting an outline for the construction of a  ‘Social Credit System’. It's main innovation, once fully implemented, could be that each citizen will be given a score measuring their sincerity, honesty, and integrity and that this score will then be a major determinant for their lives, for instance, whether to be able to get credit, rent a flat, or buy a plane ticket, or being given preferred access to hospitals, universities and government services. Social Credit score will consider a wide range of personal factors. It also resembles, but goes further than, a range of systems that are intended to increase the prominence of reputation in relation to transactions, online platforms and in the ‘sharing economy’. Thus, we focus here on rating systems concerning individual persons. </h4>
