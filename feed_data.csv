Whatever we do, whoever we impact, whatever impressions we leave behind, and whatever people remember of us when we aren't present, are all Stories. Stories that give us glory, make us feel proud, drive the adrenaline in our veins and push us to do things, we never thought we could.

In the end, we realise, we are just Stories waiting to be told. 

Hello, I am Rishav Guha Niyogi , the President of The Climber , Chennai Chapter and these are the words I live by. While working for the Climber, I have realised that I have stories which I would love to share with whoever is ready to listen.

We all have a tendency to lose touch with what we loved as a child. Something about the social pressures of adolescence and professional pressures of young adulthood squeezes the passion out of us. We‚Äôre taught that the only reason to do something is if we‚Äôre somehow rewarded for it but not for the sheer joy of it. 

The Climber, on the other hand preached the exact opposite. It promised to be a platform where we could literally explore, fine tune and involve ourselves completely with our passion. 

It gave me Indian Youth Conclave 2017 - Chennai , an event very close to my heart. An event whose inception helped me reach where I am today. The ambience at an IYC is electric as You can see youngsters like you who were actually pursuing what they loved and how they excelled and how dedicated they were. Every speaker‚Äôs story is different but when you really look at its essence on a miniscule level they will all teach you one thing and that is what I took back from the event, it was ‚ÄúIf you do what you actually love and if you‚Äôre ready to step out of your comfort zone for it, MAGIC can really happen!""
